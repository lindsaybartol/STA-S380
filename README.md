## Probability Practice
**Part A**\n
Using the rule of total probability, we know that:
```math
P(\text{Yes}) = P(\text{RC}) \times P(\text{Yes} | \text{RC}) + P(\text{TC}) \times P(\text{Yes} | \text{TC}) = P(\text{Yes})
```
With the information given, we can fill in the equation so that: 
```math
0.3 \times 0.5 + 0.7 \times P(\text{Yes} \mid \text{TC}) = 0.65
```
After solving the equation, we find that **71.4% of people that are truthful clickers answered yes**.

**Part B**
